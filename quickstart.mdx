### Build an Assistant

We'll be building an assistant using the `Assistant` class. The LLM of choice in this example is `G4F` <sup>1</sup>.

Here, we'll add the "search" tool to allow the LLM to look up resources online.

```python app.py
from leicht import Assistant
from leicht.tools import Google

# Build an assistant
assistant = Assistant(
  "You're a helpful assistant.", # System prompt
  llm="g4f", # Specify the g4f LLM *trial only*
  tools=[Google()]
)

# Run the assistant
assistant.run("Is The Matrix 5 out yet?")
```

<sup>1</sup>G4F â€“ Although `G4F` is free, it should ONLY be used for trial and NOT for production.
