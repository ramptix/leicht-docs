## Install

First things first, install the `leicht` package. You can install it using `pip` or from source.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Pip
$ pip install leicht
```

```bash Source
$ git clone https://github.com/ramptix/leicht
$ cd leicht
$ pip install .
```

</CodeGroup>

### Build an Assistant

We'll be building an assistant using `Assistant` and the `G4F`<sup>1</sup>.

```python
from leicht import Assistant

# Build an assistant
assistant = Assistant(
  "You're a helpful assistant.", # System prompt
  llm="g4f" # Specify the g4f LLM
)

# Run the assistant
assistant.run("Hi!")
```

<sup>1</sup> Although `G4F` is free, it should ONLY be used for trial and NOT for production.

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
