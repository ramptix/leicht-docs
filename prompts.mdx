Prompts are essential when it comes to custom assistants. You can create a tailored voice for your brand or shape the LLM's response by using them.

Leicht uses [ramptix/preprompted-data](https://github.com/ramptix/preprompted-data) as the prompt index to download prompts on-demand â€” you can find prompts across various topics there.

## Use A Prompt

1. Check out the Wiki of `preprompted-data` and copy the name of your desired prompt. We'll use the name `basic` for the sake of simplicity.
2. From `leicht.prompts`, we'll import the `get_prompt()` function to fetch a prompt and cache it.

```python
from leicht.prompts import get_prompt

# Get the prompt
get_prompt("basic")

# If you wish to disable caching, add the
# no_cache option
get_prompt("basic", no_cache=True)
```

...and that's it! [2 steps](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z_MvkyuOJgk) and we're good to go.

## Prompts With Variables

Some prompts, for instance, `awesome/character` which requires two variables, support inserting texts.

`awesome/character` requires:
- `{character}` â€“ The character name.
- `{series}` â€“ The series featuring the character.

We can insert them into the prompt using Leicht:

```python
get_prompt(
  "awesome/character",
  character="Walter White",
  series="Breaking Bad"
)
```

## Usage With Assistant

The `leicht.prompts` module works seamlessly with the `Assistant` API. (Or should I say we can literally just pass the value in ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ’€)

```python
from leicht import Assistant

# Initialize an assistant
assistant = Assistant(
  description=get_llm("store/genz-memes")
)

# Watch it suffer
assistant.run("skibidi toilet")
```

## Groq (LLM)

`Groq` (LLM, inherited from `BasedLLM`) uses `functions-groq` from `preprompted-data` to implement function calling.

<Info>
  **Technical Info** The prompt is used to determine whether to use a function or not. It does not return regular replies.
